# Rabin- Karp

## String Searching Algorithm

String matching algorithms are pervasive in software. One particularly fun one, is Rabin Karp, which is used in Plagiarism detection. As a student in CS (or in any major), plagiarism detection should be of interest ;-)

Rabin Karp is relatively easy to implement. See this:

Rabin Karp has also inspired a string matching routine in Zlib (one of the most popular un/zip libraries ever). See this, directly into the source code.
