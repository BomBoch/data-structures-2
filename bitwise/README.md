# BitWise

Bitwise AND a & b Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are ones.
Bitwise OR  a | b Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either or both operands are ones.
Bitwise XOR a ^ b Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either but not both operands are ones.
Bitwise NOT ~ a Inverts the bits of its operand.
Left shift  a << b  Shifts a in binary representation b (< 32) bits to the left, shifting in zeroes from the right.
Sign-propagating right shift  a >> b  Shifts a in binary representation b (< 32) bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off.
Zero-fill right shift a >>> b Shifts a in binary representation b (< 32) bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off, and shifting in zeroes from the left.
