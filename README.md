# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo is a collection of common data structures, and alogirthims you might encounter in an interview. This repo covers the following topics:

* [Binary Search Trees](https://github.com/JoeKarlsson1/data-structures/tree/master/binary-search-tree)
* [Linked Lists](/tree/master/linked-list)
* [Graph Traversing Algorithms]()
  * [Breadth First Search]()
  * [Depth First Search]()
* [Stack/Queues]()
* [Graphs]()
* [Trees]()
* [Sorting Algorithms]()
  * [Bubble Sort]()
  * [Insertion Sort]()
  * [Merge Sort]()
  * [Quick Sort (duh)]()
  * [Selection Sort]()

An algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.

"Elegant" (compact) programs, "good" (fast) programs : The notion of "simplicity and elegance" appears informally in Knuth and precisely in Chaitin:

Knuth: ". . .we want good algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense. One criterion . . . is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm . . .. Other criteria are adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc"

Chaitin: " . . . a program is 'elegant,' by which I mean that it's the smallest possible program for producing the output that it does"
