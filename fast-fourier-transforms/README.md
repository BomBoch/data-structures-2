# Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT)

### Music Search using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT)

Music recognition is done by converting it into frequency domain using FFT. FFT has implementations in number of languages. See this article for a great start: Shazam It! Music Recognition Algorithms, Fingerprinting, and Processing.
